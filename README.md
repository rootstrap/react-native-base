## Commands
1. **Start the app**. `yarn start`
2. **Lint the app**. `yarn lint`
3. **Test the app**. `yarn test`

## Getting started
1. Install dependencies: `yarn`
2. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project and define your config constants there, for example:
```
API_URL=https://rails5-api-base.herokuapp.com/api/v1
SOME_OTHER_CONFIG=something
```
3. Rename your new project using react-native-rename (https://github.com/junedomingo/react-native-rename)
4. Start on android or ios: `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios`
