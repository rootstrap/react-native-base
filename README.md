## Why React Native Base?

Starting a react native project is often difficult and time consuming, because we need to set up a lot of dependencies and configurations, that almost every time would be the same or at least very similar for every project.

Here at Rootstrap we've been working and iterating over this project for a couple of years pulling together the best practices and tools to build high-quality React Native applications, and we think that this template will help you get started quickly and efficiently.

## Getting Started

System Requirements:

- React Native Environment: [Check official docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

### Installation

> 1. Clone the react-native-base repository:
>
> ```console
> $ git clone https://github.com/rootstrap/react-native-base
> ```
>
> 2. Change to the project directory:
>
> ```console
> $ cd react-native-base
> ```
>
> 3. Install the dependencies:
>
> ```console
> $ yarn install
> $ cd ios && pod install
> or
> $ npx pod-install
> ```

### Run your application on ü§ñ Android or üçé iOS

<h4>We have flavors for Android and schemes for iOS to manage different environments</h4>
<p align="left">
You can easily run and build both platforms using the commands below:</p>

>
> ```console
> $ yarn ios:dev 
> $ yarn ios:qa
> $ yarn ios:release:qa
> $ yarn android:dev
> $ yarn android:qa
> $ yarn android:release:qa
> ```
> Check the package.json to see the full list of commands

### Tests

> Run the test suite using the command below:
>
> ```console
> $ yarn test
> ```

### Bump version

> Bump the version of the application using the command below:
>
> ```console
> $ yarn bump
> ```

Here you will be prompted to select the environment and the version you want to bump.

### Rename application

> Rename the application using the command below:
>
> ```console
> $ yarn rename

## Using Fast Folder Structure with our template

There's a folder named .fttemplates where you'll find a template to be used with the extension [vscode-fast-folder-structure](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Huuums.vscode-fast-folder-structure) to create components faster.

Then, you can create components by clicking on the Create new templated folder button in the context menu.
