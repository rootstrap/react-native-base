fastlane documentation

We use [Fastlane](https://docs.fastlane.tools/) for automating the iOS application build and submission

## Installation and requirements

* Make sure you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:

```
xcode-select --install
```

* Install _fastlane_ using
```
[sudo] gem install fastlane -NV
```
or alternatively using `brew cask install fastlane`

# Project setup

1. Generate certificate and profiles for each target
2. [Disable automatic signing](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Procedures/Procedures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005929-CH4-SW7) for each target in XCode and associate to the right provisioning profile
3. For uploading the builds to TestFlight, [AppStore Connect API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/creating_api_keys_for_app_store_connect_api) keys are required
4. For uploading the builds to S3, [AWS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys) with valid permissions are required
