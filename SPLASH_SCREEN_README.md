# Adding a Splash Screen

It was used the package [react-native-splash-screen](https://github.com/crazycodeboy/react-native-splash-screen) to add the splash screen functionality with placeholder images.

## Updating the images

For android the assets can be found in:

```
android/app/src/main/res
```

And iOs in:

```
ios/ReactNativeBase/Images.xcassets/LaunchImage.launchimage
```

The images must be replaced with the correct resolutions and sizes. This can be accomplished using the tool [generator-rn-toolbox](https://github.com/bamlab/generator-rn-toolbox/blob/master/generators/assets/README.md).
